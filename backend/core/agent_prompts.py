    If the text is not a formal legal document, you must reject it.
    - **Reject:** Essays, letters, blog posts, stories, code, casual emails, meeting notes, or any text that lacks a clear legal structure.
    - **Action:** For anything that is not a clear legal document, use **"no_document_found"**.
